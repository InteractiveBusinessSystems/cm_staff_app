    <div class="responsibilitiesHeader" id="sponsorbooth">Sponsor Booth</div>
        <div  class="responsibilitiesSubHeader">Sponsor Arrival and Setup- Weds afternoon until about 8pm, and Thursday morning:</div>
        <div  class="responsibilitiesSubHeader">General</div>
        <ol>
            <li>Helping with all the "I need X" type requests. Usually the X is something like an extra power strip, chair, question about wall hanging, etc. In most cases, they will be telling the sponsor to check with the Kalahari and help get the right contact.</li>
            <li>Helping with all the "where are things at?"  You'll help point out directions and locations to things. This is for both attendees and sponsors.</li>
            <li>Keeping a TODO list with contact info for any special requests while Jason and I aren't there.</li>

        <div  class="responsibilitiesSubHeader">Scanning Related</div>
        <ol>
            <li>Sponsors will need to get their emails assigned so they can do scanning. The app is locked down a bit more this year, so I anticipate a lot of walk ups. The volunteer is responsible for pointing the sponsor to a google form where the sponsor can type in their email and sponsor company. After that, when I get back to the booth I will add them (and confirm they can scan).</li>
            <li>Help with the kiosk app (at the sponsor booth) so people can register their badge.</li>
            <li>We created a video this year to tell the sponsors how to do the scanning, so the volunteer will provide this information for people having issues/questions and general tech tips. Many sponsors don't really have much of a clue when it comes to technology.</li>
        </ol>

    <div class="responsibilitiesSubHeader">Raffle Prizes (Friday)</div>
        <ol>

            <li>Working with us to put buckets out so attendees can drop in tickets. I believe these are going to be put across from registration this year.</li>
            <li>Collecting raffle prizes at the sponsor booth. Later, helping organize them and load them up on the cart. Some prizes will go to KidzMash, others will be for CodeMash</li>
