While the core language has remained quirky and downright confusing at times, it has spread like a virus from the web to the server and into other aspects of your every day life. We’ll ignore the benefits and drawbacks of using JavaScript powered toasters for this precompiler and focus instead on server side development with Node.js.

This precompiler will not advocate the use of Node.js for every problem ever just because it is the new hawtness. While it may be hawt, and it may look good on your resume, it is not the best solution for all problems. We will openly discuss it’s strengths and weaknesses and focus in on the type of applications that make sense for Node.js. Specifically, this session will hone in on providing real time, two way communication between web clients and server side applications. If you have ever encountered this scenario, or think you might in the future, you should definitely think about leveraging the benefits of Node.js.

We'll use a structured curriculum to guide students through introductory aspects of Node.js, eventually building a realtime web socket solution that shows off it's true power. This precompiler assumes 0 knowledge of anything Node.js, although you may need a pair partner if you are not very familiar with the JavaScript programming language. Bring a laptop, a friend, and your brain, and walk away with a life-altering, mind-expanding experience (or at least enough Node.js knowledge to land a new job).</Abstract><Id>2874</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Zambezi</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-06T12:00:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-06T08:00:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Pre-Compiler</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Todd</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/6d956728ae5a3c71832708c5741cd11d</GravatarUrl><Id>6136f4c0-6991-4a55-a6e3-3e39d825da97</Id><LastName>Kaufman</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Amber</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/7c2a83b93fe0e5f2ed4c95c59367259c</GravatarUrl><Id>5736f80b-9729-40f5-91e3-c45356c7e420</Id><LastName>Conville</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>JavaScript</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Intro to Node.JS</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>Wonder what all the Cloud Computing hype is about?

It's used everywhere from modest scripts to large systems, powering things like websites, games, film production tools, scientific analysis, and even space programs. Best of all, it's a language that "fits your brain".

This session is a mostly self guided introduction to Python through koans. What’s a koan you ask? It’s a small puzzle or exercise expressed as a test, designed to build your knowledge of the Python syntax and idioms incrementally.

Students will be completing the exercises either with a partner or alone. This allows them to think through the exercise, giving a better foundation on which to build. We'll be there to explain what is happening and why your solution works as well as strategically intervening with relevant discussion about the koans.

Students are expected to bring a laptop pre installed with Git and Python (version 2.7 or 3.4).</Abstract><Id>2745</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Guava</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Tamarind</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-06T12:00:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-06T08:00:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Pre-Compiler</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>David</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/00574728e2f964ce98a8f3adc826f8c8</GravatarUrl><Id>850e57a0-798c-4ceb-aaaf-76c0a1144669</Id><LastName>Stanek</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Mike</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/e4c5e3c69566ff80db62a4ab521b6e5a</GravatarUrl><Id>cecf54db-632a-408f-b1dc-0c9050e4743b</Id><LastName>Pirnat</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Other</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Python Koans - An Introduction To Python</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>Scrum is simple… and also complex, easy to understand but difficult to implement. 

Like chess, the rules are straightforward but mastering the game takes perseverance, patience, and most importantly, practice! This intensive half day workshop is for you if: you are completely new to Scrum and looking to get your feet wet; you are currently practicing Scrum and looking for a refresher; you are concerned that your current Scrum (but) implementation is missing the mark. Attend and learn Scrum the way the experts teach it, by working with a cross-functional team to deliver actual working software!

Ever since the Agile Manifesto was drafted in February of 2001, the principles of agile software development have come to dominate the way we go about building systems. Over the last few years, an evolution of that agile thinking has emerged under the banner of Lean. Much like agile, the emphasis is on getting rapid feedback and embracing change. But where agile is primarily focused on how you go about building software the right way, lean thinking broadens that to ensure you’re building the right thing in the first place.

In this workshop, we’ll give you some practical experience in how to work lean. We’ll start by forming small cross-functional teams and ensure each has a product idea (either one of their own or one that is assigned). Then, each team will put into practice the lean practices that are designed to help you eliminate wasted time and effort in finding product/market fit. You’ll identify core underlying assumptions about the product/business. Then you’ll design and conduct experiments which can help you assess the validity of those assumptions. Based on what you learn, you’ll adjust the core idea and iterate until you have a product idea that is better than what you started with.

This is a great session for the technical and non-technical alike.</Abstract><Id>2503</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Mangrove</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-06T12:00:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-06T08:00:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Pre-Compiler</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Mike</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/38716536d6ac1c63fc17ae4fa1cfca0c</GravatarUrl><Id>6e19a7c8-db38-480b-8258-9f9e72ae19b1</Id><LastName>Doel</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Gina</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/31232f8fd8c8f05be6bd243a6355b098</GravatarUrl><Id>7645c54a-325e-4fff-a18c-8cd87bd60020</Id><LastName>Winkler</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Soft Skills / Business</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Working Lean</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>Seriously!

If your list isn’t sorted, you’d have to use a strategy such as starting at the top and reading every entry until you find the one you wanted.  This might be too time-consuming when there’s a race to be won!

Thankfully, computers excel at sorting lists.  But how do they do that?  In this highly interactive session, you will become the computer and, with the help of your friends, you’ll work through some of the basic sorting methods used in computer science.  You’ll keep track of various metrics, such as the number of item comparisons required to get the data ordered correctly, so that you can determine how fast each method is under what conditions.  By the end of this session, you’ll know exactly which technique you’d choose to sort that list and win that race!

And not to worry:  No computer or Kalahari animal shall be used or harmed in the preparation or presentation of this dynamic session.

While this makes up most communication, there are a lot of other factors that we take for granted such body movements and context from our surroundings. Communication with computers is completely different. Computers are literal, only recognize certain languages, and can't fill in the gaps. In this session Matt will talk about different ways we communicate with computers with input devices and programming languages. Matt will also pretend to be a computer in an interactive programming session to make a sandwich, with hilarious consequences to literal translations of instructions.

Note that this session will be geared for ages 4-7. Let Matt know whether food allergies or diet prohibit a snack of wheat bread, sunflower seed butter, and grape jelly.

We expect a lot from modern web applications (many run entirely in the browser), but we’re rarely writing tests to verify that our high expectations are met.

Come explore the magical world of Frontend Testing with the Sparkbox team. Together we will examine the pain points of developing without tests and look at some of our real-world examples. We’ll also talk about what you should and shouldn't test, and get our hands dirty with...

- Jasmine / CoffeeScript
- Automating tests in the build process
- Adding tests to existing code
- Refactoring jQuery spaghetti
- Handling AJAX requests and Promises
- Coding for better tests
- Running tests in a CI build

Prepare to receive the tools and techniques to build solid, tested frontend code. And don't worry—we'll talk about selling the concept to your team back home and gradually work it into your process.

The TSN has sent the Artemis-class Battleship Artemis and the Kiev-class Light Cruiser Intrepid to the nearby Command Station Campbell in order to retake the station.  Expecting to face a few inferior rebel ships protecting the station, the two TSN ships discover only fleets from the other interstellar governments closing on the stations.
 
On the plus side, Asimov Station’s shields are offline. The Artemis must dock with the station and drop off a squad of Space Marines while the shields are down. These Space Marines must infiltrate the rebel station, complete their mission, and exfiltrate via one of the starships before the rebels can get the shields back online. Meanwhile, the two starships must fend off the alien fleets in order to buy the Marines time to complete their mission.

Gameplay Overview: This will be an Artemis-Integrated Live Action Scenario Game for up to 24 players per run. Each run will last 90 minutes and will include team selection, training, and scenario play. Players will be randomly selected to be on one of four teams: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and Delta. Alpha and Bravo will consist of six players each which will be the bridge crews of the Artemis (Alpha) and the Intrepid (Bravo). The six players of Charlie team will be the Space Marines, and the six players of Delta will be the rebel defenders. Charlie and Delta teams will be given laser tag rifles to simulate combat. All teams will be given more details and training at the time of the event.</Abstract><Id>3012</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Banyan Hut</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-06T19:45:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-06T18:00:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>CodeMash Schedule Item</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName> </FirstName><GravatarUrl>http://www.codemash.org/wp-content/themes/codemash/images/codemash-icon.png</GravatarUrl><Id>275c4701-2744-4f7a-b1e7-58e0e284f1e9</Id><LastName>CodeMash</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Other</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Incident at Asimov Station (#1)</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>There will be two shuttles running loops through all of the official hotels.

The TSN has sent the Artemis-class Battleship Artemis and the Kiev-class Light Cruiser Intrepid to the nearby Command Station Campbell in order to retake the station.  Expecting to face a few inferior rebel ships protecting the station, the two TSN ships discover only fleets from the other interstellar governments closing on the stations.
 
On the plus side, Asimov Station’s shields are offline. The Artemis must dock with the station and drop off a squad of Space Marines while the shields are down. These Space Marines must infiltrate the rebel station, complete their mission, and exfiltrate via one of the starships before the rebels can get the shields back online. Meanwhile, the two starships must fend off the alien fleets in order to buy the Marines time to complete their mission.

Gameplay Overview: This will be an Artemis-Integrated Live Action Scenario Game for up to 24 players per run. Each run will last 90 minutes and will include team selection, training, and scenario play. Players will be randomly selected to be on one of four teams: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and Delta. Alpha and Bravo will consist of six players each which will be the bridge crews of the Artemis (Alpha) and the Intrepid (Bravo). The six players of Charlie team will be the Space Marines, and the six players of Delta will be the rebel defenders. Charlie and Delta teams will be given laser tag rifles to simulate combat. All teams will be given more details and training at the time of the event.</Abstract><Id>3013</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Banyan Hut</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-06T21:45:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-06T20:00:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>CodeMash Schedule Item</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName> </FirstName><GravatarUrl>http://www.codemash.org/wp-content/themes/codemash/images/codemash-icon.png</GravatarUrl><Id>275c4701-2744-4f7a-b1e7-58e0e284f1e9</Id><LastName>CodeMash</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Other</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Incident at Asimov Station (#2)</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>(136 min) (PG-13) Bring a beverage.

It can also be one of the most terrifying. Being on your own can seem like it's nothing but ponies, unicorns and rainbows, but it's a lot of work, and success is not guaranteed.

 Mike, an independent developer since 2001, will discuss the lesson's he's learned over the years along with the ups and downs he's experienced. In this updated and expanded session, he will be joined by friend and attorney Jeffrey Strauss to help answer the most common questions he's been asked over the years.

This is nonsense, particularly at a time when the opportunities for self-publishing have never been greater thanks to an explosion of available tools and services. In this 1/2 day seminar bestselling author Jason Gilmore will introduce you to the process, techniques and technologies he’s used to successfully publish several very popular programming books. 

You’ll learn how to identify a market-worthy topic, build a list of interested customers before you’ve even written a word, create and execute a sane writing schedule, convert your manuscript into a professional, polished book, and sell your book through key channels such as Amazon.com, iBooks, Google Play and Leanpub. Jason will illustrate the concepts discussed throughout with real-world examples and data drawn upon his own self-publishing experience, and additionally furnish a wealth of information for those attendees also interested in publishing through traditional channels. 

We'll also work through the process of creating a new book draft inside Leanpub, effectively clearing away the first major barrier towards publishing your book. You will walk away with a well-rounded understanding of the publishing process, and should you decide take the plunge you will know exactly what steps to take to turn your idea into a book!</Abstract><Id>2870</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Portia</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Wisteria</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-07T12:00:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-07T08:00:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Pre-Compiler</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Jason</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/0453f338d4cb39a6943df84a4a228a52</GravatarUrl><Id>658c587b-e064-4087-a54c-d59f72bd76e4</Id><LastName>Gilmore</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Other</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>How to Write and Self-Publish a Financially Successful Tech book</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>In this interactive session, you'll learn some of the basic principles and practices of writing better quality code: testing and pairing.

At some point we have to be able to make sense of the data. Unfortunately many of the tools we have historically used can not scale up to the terabytes and petabytes we have captured. Hadoop is one of those relatively new technologies that is taking the industry by storm since it has proven to scale by taking advantage of the MapReduce pattern and distributed computing.

During this hands-on tutorial you will provision a Hadoop cluster, write MapReduce jobs and learn how to store and access data via Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). You will also learn how cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services’ Elastic MapReduce (EMR) and Microsoft’s Azure HDInsight provide Hadoop as a service.</Abstract><Id>191</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Salon E</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-07T12:00:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-07T08:00:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Pre-Compiler</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Christopher</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/46237da22a99f4aab52e802ea2c0728e</GravatarUrl><Id>1c0cadcb-c364-49d4-be90-606a931bac15</Id><LastName>Judd</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Cloud/Big Data</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Java</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Introduction to Hadoop</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>Metaprogramming is the arching principle for techniques where code does more than the strict interpretation of the computer language. It encompasses strategies as diverse as code generation, Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP), Domain Specific Languages (DSL), and runtime code creation. The new .NET Compiler as a Service (Roslyn) opens up opportunities in metaprogramming by making it practical to explore and create syntactic and semantic trees. This day starts with metaprogramming principles and an overview of techniques. The afternoon dives deep into a single easily accomplished approach to metaprogramming – code generation. You’ll learn how to think about your code as a set of patterns, unique input to those patterns and handcrafted customizations. You’ll learn more about working with the complexities of the Roslyn trees and creating custom built interfaces to simplify access to the information, for a specific purpose. You’ll leave able to create strongly typed code-first style input to your own templates and provide rich customization points that maintain application integrity. Use these techniques to remove the boring, stupid parts of application development. </Abstract><Id>1264</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Orange</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-07T12:00:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-07T08:00:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Pre-Compiler</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Kathleen</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/85ffa8bf46389d3c399196f3497bd626</GravatarUrl><Id>0858d0e5-564d-494d-aed6-8d5f744ebe37</Id><LastName>Dollard</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>.NET</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Metaprogramming on the .NET Platform (Part 1)</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>Armed with an Arduino, MacGyver-like circuitry, cheap wood, and JavaScript, can you rise to the call of battle?

We have lots of story cards prepared covering features from combat to magic, classes to spells, and races to items. Plus, we'll be defining some of these cards during the session in case you want that +9 knife of ogre slaying or enjoy casting magic missile at the darkness.

This workshop is language agnostic and for all levels of developers. The focus is on TDD and emergent design but pair programming will be covered as well. The only requirement is that you bring a laptop and that you be able to test-drive you code with your language of choice. When you are done you will emerge a better programmer for the experience but there is small chance you will have a craving for Cheetos and Mountain Dew.</Abstract><Id>24</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Mangrove</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-07T12:00:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-07T08:00:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Pre-Compiler</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>George</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/a9045200c84fc370f06b04bc49047494</GravatarUrl><Id>4124580e-cc53-4de0-b9ce-99fc7c3a2e5b</Id><LastName>Walters</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Guy</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/1e0e9da43623ecdb31a7a1a74c03c1e4</GravatarUrl><Id>650ec138-e69a-4c21-a4b6-8ea6bd81e1c2</Id><LastName>Royse</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Other</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Putting the D&amp;D in TDD (Part 1)</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>The major cause of web insecurity is insecure software development practices.

We’ll start with discussing how important clear acceptance criteria are, then do practical implementations of functional tests dealing with common situations such as input validation, AJAX delays, and yes, downloading Zip files.

Along the way you’ll pick up critical concepts like dealing with a web page’s DOM, element locators, and tools to help you interact with these. You’ll also learn UI automation programming concepts like the Page Object Pattern, implicit and explicit waits, and modularizing your tests. 

You’ll also learn why testing at the UI isn’t enough—and you’ll learn how to build helper APIs to handle true testing heuristics as part of your tests.

Additionally, you’ll see where you need to work together with developers to create a system that’s more easily testable. We’ll walk through simple changes you can make to your UI, and we’ll look at how turning off features like CAPTCHA can ease your testing woes and dramatically decrease your scotch consumption.

This session focuses primarily on automating web tests, but many of the same concepts can be applied to other UI environments too. Demos and labs will be in C# using WebDriver, but we’ll also discuss Watir, MS Web Test, and Telerik’s Test Studio. You’ll also learn how Jeff Morgan’s page_objects gem might be a great fit for your environment if you’re working with Ruby. We'll briefly cover acceptance tools like Fitness and Cucumber, and how they can bring great value to your process, too.

You’ll leave this session having learned how to deal with functional testing from A to Z. You’ll also learn critical factors for success in keeping your tests running quickly, and avoiding brittle tests that break frequently.</Abstract><Id>18</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Guava</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Tamarind</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-07T12:00:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-07T08:00:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Pre-Compiler</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Jim</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/fd80f9c58b06270d42356dd77a32defa</GravatarUrl><Id>7d4be401-1141-4c31-b440-fed0a0c877ed</Id><LastName>Holmes</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>JavaScript</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Ruby/Rails</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>.NET</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Testing</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Web UI Testing from Acceptance Criteria to Zip Files (Part 1)</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>Why should  the parents have to have all the fun programming?

It's 2015, of course you do... at least, you probably know how to use it... so long as you stick to the standard operators, of course.
But how does it *really* work? What's lurking beneath the calm surface of lambda expressions?

LINQ may feel a bit retro now, with C# 6 on the horizon, but it's a fascinating topic to dig into... then dig further... and further.

Thrill to see query expressions converted into normal C#!
Swoon over the complex state machine generated by a simple iterator block!
Gasp at the nuances of optimizing lazily-evaluated sequences!
Rejoice as your own code extends LINQ to Objects seamlessly!</Abstract><Id>2888</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Zambezi</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-07T17:00:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-07T13:00:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Pre-Compiler</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Jon</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/9e8277f815de909df256027d206ca72a</GravatarUrl><Id>abec4332-6adf-41fe-9e60-0585e2e13bdb</Id><LastName>Skeet</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>.NET</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Adventures in LINQ: party like it's 2007 (Part 2)</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>Learn to create cross platform mobile applications for iOS, Android and Windows Phone, with Xamarin.Forms.

With only a laptop running Windows and an HTML-5 capable browser, you can create wicked-cool games for iOS, Android, and Windows.  Start from scratch or build on templates to create shooters, platformers, side-runners, physics puzzles, driving games, and more without having to code your own physics engine.  In this workshop, beginning and experienced developers alike will learn Construct 2 (from Scirra) with plenty of hands-on time to build a compelling, addictive game!  

Under the covers, this tool uses HTML5 and JavaScript.  This makes it easy and fun for beginners to create games, and more advanced developers can rapidly prototype games and dive into the underlying HTML5 and JavaScript.

It can also be one of the most terrifying. Being on your own can seem like it's nothing but ponies, unicorns and rainbows, but it's a lot of work, and success is not guaranteed.

 Mike, an independent developer since 2001, will discuss the lesson's he's learned over the years along with the ups and downs he's experienced. In this updated and expanded session, he will be joined by friend and attorney Jeffrey Strauss to help answer the most common questions he's been asked over the years.

IoT is the next evolution of distributed and connected systems at scale. It’s more than just connecting your phone to your thermostat, it’s about connected systems at scale so devices and people can interact in ways that was the realm of sci-fi just a few years ago. It gets interesting when devices are connected and able to inform and act based on their own environment and from an outside perspective, the world is just a smarter place. 

In this session, we’ll discuss what IoT actually means and how it’s different (or not) from the connected systems of the past. Then we’ll dive into some code and demos to get a handful of devices up and running and connected to a cloud system where we can start applying machine learning to the telemetry data and start making intelligent decisions and take actions based on our learnings.

It encompasses strategies as diverse as code generation, Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP), Domain Specific Languages (DSL), and runtime code creation. The new .NET Compiler as a Service (Roslyn) opens up opportunities in metaprogramming by making it practical to explore and create syntactic and semantic trees. This day starts with metaprogramming principles and an overview of techniques. The afternoon dives deep into a single easily accomplished approach to metaprogramming – code generation. You’ll learn how to think about your code as a set of patterns, unique input to those patterns and handcrafted customizations. You’ll learn more about working with the complexities of the Roslyn trees and creating custom built interfaces to simplify access to the information, for a specific purpose. You’ll leave able to create strongly typed code-first style input to your own templates and provide rich customization points that maintain application integrity. Use these techniques to remove the boring, stupid parts of application development. </Abstract><Id>2896</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Orange</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-07T17:00:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-07T13:00:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Pre-Compiler</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Kathleen</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/85ffa8bf46389d3c399196f3497bd626</GravatarUrl><Id>0858d0e5-564d-494d-aed6-8d5f744ebe37</Id><LastName>Dollard</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>.NET</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Metaprogramming on the .NET Platform (Part 2)</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>Armed with an Arduino, MacGyver-like circuitry, cheap wood, and JavaScript, can you rise to the call of battle?

If so, this is the session for you! In this TDD workshop we will be building the domain model for EverCraft -- a new MMORPG from Blizzards of the Coast. We have lots of story cards prepared covering features from combat to magic, classes to spells, and races to items. Plus, we'll be defining some of these cards during the session in case you want that +9 knife of ogre slaying or enjoy casting magic missile at the darkness.

This workshop is language agnostic and for all levels of developers. The focus is on TDD and emergent design but pair programming will be covered as well. The only requirement is that you bring a laptop and that you be able to test-drive you code with your language of choice.

While this makes up most communication, there are a lot of other factors that we take for granted such body movements and context from our surroundings. Communication with computers is completely different. Computers are literal, only recognize certain languages, and can't fill in the gaps. In this session Matt will talk about different ways we communicate with computers with input devices and programming languages. Matt will also pretend to be a computer in an interactive programming session to make a sandwich, with hilarious consequences to literal translations of instructions. We will also play a game where blindfolded attendees are given instructions by other attendees to complete a task.

Note that this session will be geared for ages 8-12. Let Matt know whether food allergies or diet prohibit a snack of wheat bread, sunflower seed butter, and grape jelly.</Abstract><Id>2882</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Acacia - Sessionz</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-07T16:00:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-07T15:00:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Kidz Mash</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Matt</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/883ba850f0f07fcfdefafbd16836fdcb</GravatarUrl><Id>4513f720-37e6-4531-b5cb-bab055235fd7</Id><LastName>Casto</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Other</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Talking to Computers (ages 8-12)</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>(97 min) (PG) Bring a beverage.

The TSN has sent the Artemis-class Battleship Artemis and the Kiev-class Light Cruiser Intrepid to the nearby Command Station Campbell in order to retake the station.  Expecting to face a few inferior rebel ships protecting the station, the two TSN ships discover only fleets from the other interstellar governments closing on the stations.
 
On the plus side, Asimov Station’s shields are offline. The Artemis must dock with the station and drop off a squad of Space Marines while the shields are down. These Space Marines must infiltrate the rebel station, complete their mission, and exfiltrate via one of the starships before the rebels can get the shields back online. Meanwhile, the two starships must fend off the alien fleets in order to buy the Marines time to complete their mission.

Gameplay Overview: This will be an Artemis-Integrated Live Action Scenario Game for up to 24 players per run. Each run will last 90 minutes and will include team selection, training, and scenario play. Players will be randomly selected to be on one of four teams: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and Delta. Alpha and Bravo will consist of six players each which will be the bridge crews of the Artemis (Alpha) and the Intrepid (Bravo). The six players of Charlie team will be the Space Marines, and the six players of Delta will be the rebel defenders. Charlie and Delta teams will be given laser tag rifles to simulate combat. All teams will be given more details and training at the time of the event.</Abstract><Id>3015</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Banyan Hut</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-07T19:45:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-07T18:00:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>CodeMash Schedule Item</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName> </FirstName><GravatarUrl>http://www.codemash.org/wp-content/themes/codemash/images/codemash-icon.png</GravatarUrl><Id>275c4701-2744-4f7a-b1e7-58e0e284f1e9</Id><LastName>CodeMash</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Other</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Incident at Asimov Station (#4)</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>Hey Little (and Big) ones, join, if you dare, Aydin your tour guide, on an adventure down the Scary Kalahari River!

ReactiveCocoa (RAC) is a framework that brings the (functional) reactive programming world into the grossly imperative land of iOS. It builds off of Cocoa's own key-value observing mechanism to provide a high-level, declarative API for composing operations on streams of data, state, and asynchronous tasks. You’ll leave this session with a solid foundation of RAC and how one can apply it in conjunction with powerful tools like MVVM to build applications.</Abstract><Id>2848</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Salon D</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-08T09:00:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-08T08:00:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Andrew</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/f3c52a0537360c85b46e043711cab0c6</GravatarUrl><Id>f651be9d-2e2f-4eeb-8c19-b499517851c7</Id><LastName>Sardone</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Mobile</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Functional Programming</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Be proactive, use reactive!</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>While many talks provide a high level overview of a few components of the Azure platform, this session will provide real-world examples of how we utilize Azure on real-world, highly scalable applications.

Key areas we will demonstrate and discuss include:

•	General scalability and moving a heavy amount of workload off the web servers
•	Using the Azure Service Bus to communicate between our front-end web servers and our back-end worker roles
•	 Azure’s caching options and how we utilize them to serve a significant amount of data to clients out of memory and to support things such as ASP.NET Session State.
•	Using Blob Storage as an effectively unlimited amount of file storage.
•	Our usage of newer features such as the scheduler, mobile notifications, and auto scaling.
•	Our development and deployment process surrounding Azure based applications

This session, while only an hour long, will walk through a lot of code and tooling to show how we have leaned on Azure to solve a number of architectural headaches.

If you are using (or considering using) Azure as the foundation for your own applications, this session would be a great place to get ideas on where you should start.

It has the power of Erlang but in a modern, elegant, and beautiful form. Elixir makes it easy to write highly distributed systems in a reliable and scalable manner. This presentation will introduce the language and the tools to let you immediately write Elixir programs. Concepts introduced include modules, control and data structures, pattern matching, recursions, pipes (really cool), functional operations, and distributed messaging. We will avoid the classic functional jargon and concentrate on the productive side of the language. While showing these concepts, we will use the repl, the build tool, and unit testing. The session will include many pre-written code examples and will encourage audience participation. By the end of the presentation, it is hoped that you will be as excited about the language as the the presenter is.</Abstract><Id>2710</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Portia</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Wisteria</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-08T09:00:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-08T08:00:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Abdul</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/f4476549f95e5ef9e746ee66a55832b3</GravatarUrl><Id>38b9c6ae-5a37-4822-ae77-db0d6d968a91</Id><LastName>Habra</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Functional Programming</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Elixir For The Impatient</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>Drop in and play a game.

Most developers who use generics think of them only for collections, when they are valuable in any situation where code is the same except for type.  This session is a deep dive into generic classes, interfaces, methods, and delegates.  You will learn how to increase the power of generics by applying constraints, and will see examples drawn from real applications.  You will leave with ideas about how to apply generics in your development and understanding the .NET features necessary to realize those ideas.

You seem to go from one line to the next - waiting for your turn to be processed.  Getting your boarding pass in one line, x-rayed in another, snacks in another.  Each line you stand in is completely unrelated to all the other lines, yet, they each play an important role in the overall process of getting you to your destination.  Building scaleable distributed applications has many of those same characteristics.  Seemingly disjointed, independent processes that work together to perform a larger function.  This talk will focus on the design characteristics of this approach and include some real world examples using Golang, Docker &amp; RabbitMQ - though this technique is tool agnostic.  The airport metaphor will be stretched to the limit and there are sure to be some groan-worthy examples.</Abstract><Id>2696</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Guava</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Tamarind</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-08T09:00:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-08T08:00:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>William</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/bfb804e585be282f398765068688a7ed</GravatarUrl><Id>cad83e09-d051-4a08-97ee-4532d7e03df4</Id><LastName>Klos</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Cloud/Big Data</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Other</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Modeling Your Applications Based on Airport Operations.

The Java Programming language does not provide native key defenses necessary to thoroughly prevent XSS. As technologies such as Content Security Policy emerge, we still need pragmatic advice to stop XSS in legacy applications as well as new applications using traditional Java frameworks. First generation encoding libraries had both performance and completeness problems that prevent developers from through, production-safe XSS defense.

Wouldn’t it be even better if, upon a successful build, the latest executables were automatically deployed to your test bed without you lifting a finger? If you’re not lucky enough to be deploying to a cloud platform that provides such functionality out of the box, automating your process might seem daunting. In this session, Danielle will demonstrate how you can leverage tools such as TeamCity and Octopus Deploy to automate your builds and deployments. You’ll be introduced to a variety of options you can use to customize the process in order to meet your particular requirements. Along the way, you’ll learn about some neat productivity features you may wish to leverage as well as some pitfalls you would do well to avoid.

You’ll leave this session with the knowledge of how to automate your own builds and deployments and how to extend that automation chain so you can reach the next level.  Test automation, anyone?

We’ll look at each in turn and determine if each holds true or can be labeled as busted. There will be audience participation and prizes including the latest season of Myth Busters and a copy of Steve Krug’s, Rocket Surgery Made Easy. Armed with the truth, you will be able to reliably defend against the onslaught of poor UX, perpetrated by design-by-committee, and reach true UX harmony.</Abstract><Id>1285</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Nile</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-08T11:30:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-08T10:30:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Benjamin</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/be48605fbebdfc63d4b7bda8ec43d62b</GravatarUrl><Id>4163247f-ab54-494e-a2d6-12040f79425b</Id><LastName>Bykowski</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Design (UI/UX/CSS)</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Adventures Beyond the Page Fold - Exploring UX Mythology</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>Ever want to know how computers think?

As developers and operations staff we sometimes find ourselves with infrastructure and code bases growing under our feet and in our sleep and sometimes managed services stop meeting the needs of a business or project. 

Once your business grows to the point where you have dedicated Sales, QA, and Growth departments, how do you manage to keep all the environments for everyone in check? When your bundling and asset compilation takes 30 minutes, how do you get hot fixes out in any reasonable amount of time? When your dev staff is distributed, how can you ensure everyone has access to the proper environment, and more importantly, that they don't have potentially destructive powers in places they shouldn't?

We've struggled with each of these questions, and after a lot of trial and error, ended up on a Docker based build and deploy system that accelerated our build times, time through CI, QA deploys, and general time to production with little to no downtime. We've also been able to deploy the same applications for demo use offline, quickly scale applications in the case of emergency, provide developer safe security, and a whole lot more

In this talk we'll talk about Rails-specific practices for building your app into a Docker image and what benefits you get immediately from that alone. Then we'll talk about how you can use that image through the rest of your dev process cycle to get the ease of use of a managed service with the freedom to use your container as you please. </Abstract><Id>2758</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Salon D</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-08T11:30:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-08T10:30:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Michael</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/6489f517b0bd2c63487d0b1a65665d5f</GravatarUrl><Id>e8288715-7e72-4d34-a957-74aa0d90ee5f</Id><LastName>Danko</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Ruby/Rails</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Business Scale Rails with Docker</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>Composition is powerful. Consider any artistic endeavor; any style of music, art, photography, etc. Creativity thrives on composition. The bringing together of various elements into a complementary whole. Carefully selected, simple pieces assembled with skill and insight can yield breathtaking complexity and beauty.

Yet composition s not widely used as a paradigm in creating software today. While it sounds nice in theory to write small, simple, and correct pieces of code and then plug them together, there is little in the way of practical examples to show how it's done. With practice, designing for composition can become second nature.

This talk will use the problem of writing a Clojure-to-C compiler as an example. A full explanation of the process, with code, will demonstrate how to accomplish this in Clojure while the concepts will be applicable to any functional programming language.</Abstract><Id>195</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Salon H</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-08T11:30:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-08T10:30:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Jim</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/e0731cde23f6de1006979c12551d1860</GravatarUrl><Id>f4ee9fc6-7ed1-4adc-8eab-d8cc8b455709</Id><LastName>Duey</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Functional Programming</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Composing a Compiler</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>Every application we build is subject to attack.

Yet many web developers don't spend the extra time to do it right. It is estimated that as many as one in five people have some sort of disability or impairment. Regardless of the purpose of the application this is essential to consider.

This session will include an in-depth discussion of web accessibility guidelines and standards following the WCAG 2.0 specification.  It will also focus on a how-to for actually implementing these guidelines and building them into the UI of any web-based application. The web developer that is already skilled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, will learn practical coding techniques to make their applications accessible to all.</Abstract><Id>2511</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Salon H</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-08T12:45:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-08T11:45:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Bobby</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/1caa69e97547306f38c792b705afdb9a</GravatarUrl><Id>a6bec37c-9939-41a9-93e4-6b3f8a9e55ce</Id><LastName>Whitman</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Design (UI/UX/CSS)</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>JavaScript</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Building with Web Accessibility in Mind</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>Discover Swift, the new programming language from Apple.

It’s also not a lot of things, and the differences can lead to confusion and incorrect assumptions.  DevOps is related to Agile, but it’s not the same thing as Agile.  It needs tools, but the tools are just a part of the story.  DevOps is a cultural shift, a methodology, an operational philosophy, and a metaphor for software delivery.  It’s only about five years old, so it’s still toddling around development teams, management meetings, and executive boardrooms, attracting attention with every conversation.  The DevOps meme is about to go hype-rsonic, as Agile did about ten years ago.  When that happens, you’ll want to have a good idea what it is, what is isn’t, and why you and your company should care.
	This presentation will cut through the hype and boil DevOps down to its bare essentials.  I’ll talk about what DevOps is and the value it offers.  I’ll dispel a few common myths, and demonstrate resources for supporting DevOps Transformation in your organization.  DevOps means different things to different people, so we’ll talk about how to communicate DevOps concepts to various enterprise stakeholders.  When we’re done, you’ll be empowered to go out into the world and talk about DevOps, and maybe even help make it happen at your company.

This includes getting your test environments ready for testing. Often test environments have been on closed internal networks that are not accessible from the internet. Delivering and testing a mobile application on a 3G or 4G network changes all that. Coming up with a supported platform strategy is also paramount to success. One needs to take network speed, device features, screen size and resolution as well as multi-tasking life-cycles into effect when testing. QA testers will need to become familiar on how to service the devices they test with as well. Additionally the team will need to incorporate field testing prior to delivery. This presentation will organize the challenges a modern QA team has to contend with, and make some strong suggestions on how to craft a respectable Mobile Test Strategy.</Abstract><Id>2741</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Guava</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Tamarind</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-08T12:45:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-08T11:45:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Geoffrey</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/940906757c2b8631cab8b60f4adb61a3</GravatarUrl><Id>3cb8e713-ebfa-4b96-b4cd-2d22d96346e4</Id><LastName>Goetz</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Mobile</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Testing</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Take Your QA Team Out - Mobile Testing Strategies Everyone Should Know About</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>Smart businesses come up with a mission, vision, and values that define the way that they do business and help them focus for success.

In the last couple years, as “cloud” has become less of a buzzword, and more of a practical solution, traditional database architecture has presented a barrier to implementing medium to large scale applications.
While the big players (Microsoft and Oracle) are beginning to find ways to adapt to the needs of a cloud architecture, they are being outpaced by a new crop of databases. These databases are designed from the ground up to solve the problem of cloud scale.
This session focuses on the theory behind database distribution, starting with a definition of the problem, and ending with the varying solutions that a number of the front-runners have implemented. While it has yet to be determined which approach will win, this session will prepare the audience to make intelligent decisions about which solution works best for their particular problem domain in the present and in the future.</Abstract><Id>2660</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Mangrove</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-08T12:45:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-08T11:45:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Michael</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/954765ec98d01561285873097362e3ee</GravatarUrl><Id>5184fe1d-3b2c-4ae4-9748-4a11d41a0547</Id><LastName>Meadows</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Cloud/Big Data</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Other</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>The Silver Lining: A Deep Dive into the Architecture of Distributed Databases</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>Think your data is safe?

How does it apply to you, and what is it, exactly? This talk will answer those questions, by engaging in a basic primer on concurrency in Ruby, a discussion of actual examples of how it works, and provide you with answers that will leave you nodding in agreement, rather than nodding off.</Abstract><Id>2384</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Salon D</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-08T14:00:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-08T13:00:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Kerri</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/f4d5752d6f4f839083cf810ad2c3a911</GravatarUrl><Id>e839ede0-769a-49a7-9119-c724d202ca0f</Id><LastName>Miller</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Ruby/Rails</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Concurrency for !Dummies (Who Don't Get It (...Yet))</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>This is an introductory session to Cross-Platform Mobile Development using C# with Xamarin's tools.

It’s a simple language, but getting it right and avoiding specificity hell can be a challenge if you don’t have the right framework to back you up.  Especially in large scaling projects, you might start adding ID selectors here and !important properties there and the next thing you know you’ve backed yourself into a corner where even the smallest of UI changes will take hours to work out. Ew.

Or how about this? Ever jump into a project and find that even the slightest markup change results in broken JavaScript AND sometimes even broken backend feature tests?! WTF. Ew.

This talk will look at how taking a modular, object-oriented approach to CSS can turn frontend woes into frontend wins. We’ll examine modern CSS approaches like OOCSS, SMACSS, and BEM and demonstrate how they will help to not only decouple your CSS styles and reduce specificity conflicts, but how they will also help to decouple your CSS and HTML from your JavaScript and feature specs.</Abstract><Id>71</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Cypress</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-08T14:00:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-08T13:00:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Julie</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/f49c5780805d9e50bdc348069a7db59d</GravatarUrl><Id>1702ac5d-8845-435f-b2dc-6bbb70c7778a</Id><LastName>Cameron</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Design (UI/UX/CSS)</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Decoupling the Frontend through Modular CSS</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>ECMAScript most famous dialect is JavaScript, and the coming version is ECMAScript 6 (ES6).

Can we prioritize them and who gets to work on which idea?

Engineering teams obsess over how we manage the work of today and provide valuable feedback on the development process: Why are we building this feature? When will that feature be completed? What portions of the code changed in order to support this feature? These same teams rarely focus on the big ideas of tomorrow, even though in this information age most of what a company will do tomorrow is led by engineering.

Innovation happens best with small teams and structure, so like automated testing and builds, let's apply the same systemization to improvements and ideas so that the very best potential innovations are always at the forefront, and the best people are able to work on them at any point in time.

This reality is just over the horizon, and it brings one of the largest challenges in building distributed systems.  Today, developers often look to RESTful Web APIs to solve these problems.  Are current trends in API design really prepared to handle the demands of the future?  What’s missing from the equation?

In this session, you’ll learn new patterns for modeling Web APIs using state machines, hypermedia, and reactive streams to meet tomorrow’s challenges and make a solid attempt at standing the test of time.

Learn what you can do to make your API servers more scalable and resilient while allowing API clients to be event-driven and responsive.  A real-world example will be given of how these concepts were used to build Zetta, an open source platform for the Internet of Things.</Abstract><Id>2711</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Salon H</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-08T14:00:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-08T13:00:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Kevin</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/49e2f463432929535e81781f3490336d</GravatarUrl><Id>2daa0487-e7c9-4f7b-a869-6ad0618e6371</Id><LastName>Swiber</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Cloud/Big Data</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Other</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Reactive Hypermedia: the API Design of Tomorrow</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>At long last, Microsoft speaks NoSQL.

We all use them. Whether it's an entire toolkit, a framework that meets some specific needs, or a simple custom control from NuGet, CodePlex, or CodeProject, it is hard to ignore the opportunity to improve the rate of development while learning new things from open source projects. But what does "open source" truly mean? Especially when working in a professional or corporate environment, what are our rights and limitations as open source consumers to use, modify, and redistribute these tools? Often that depends upon the authors' own decisions regarding project licensing. In this one-hour session, we will review a few of the core principals of open-source development and consumption, comparing and contrasting some of the more popular licenses in use today. We will then discuss both how to use the open source works of others and also how to properly license your own.</Abstract><Id>2523</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Rosewood</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-08T14:00:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-08T13:00:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Jeff</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/c546a0d187d12bb1c81f0918c956c55a</GravatarUrl><Id>75538a62-da47-413c-8c73-1fb87c6c3fa4</Id><LastName>Strauss</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Soft Skills / Business</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Other</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>The Impact of Leveraging Open Source</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>Performance matters.

If you’re building a website or the next Angry Birds, this session is NOT for you. If you build applications for banking, manufacturing, healthcare, or other “real world” environments and have to balance every new and exciting innovation with existing security, privacy, and compliance obligations – as well as the obligation to keep your existing systems up and running – then you really need good application analytics – and this session is most definitely for you. 

In just 45 minutes, we’ll break out use cases, requirements, and project management best practices for deploying an effective application analytics implementation – across on-premises and hybrid environments – across desktop PCs and the latest mobile devices. Attendees will leave with a self-assessment checklist and an organized set of tasks to bring true application analytics – insights into usage, behavior and quality – to the application stakeholders that need it most.

Mobile web apps shouldn't stop working when there's no network connection. Learn how to build cross-platform mobile web apps that work just as well offline as they do online. This talk will demonstrate how you can use HTML5 and PouchDB, an open source syncing JavaScript database that runs within a web browser, to provide a better, faster user experience, both offline and online. Learn how PouchDB synchronization can be used to replicate to and from a remote database, such as CouchDB or IBM Cloudant (a globally distributed data layer for web and mobile applications), whenever an Internet connection is available.

It doesn't take much thought to realize that technology is one of, if not the most important aspect of any company that wants to be in business tomorrow.  With constant technological advances happening in the marketplace, companies must continuously evolve and update their technology or die.  Because of this do-or-die scenario, the role of the technology leader has become critical to the success of the organization.  While most companies have their own technology department, not every technology department has a strong leader.  Those that do will survive.  Those that don't...

And therein lies the rub.  Companies are in constant search mode for progressive, visionary tech leaders.  But the market is drying up.  With virtually every company in the hunt for talent, there are just too many opportunities for these leaders to choose from.

This session will discuss the evolving market for tech leaders at all levels, dispel some old images of what makes a strong tech leader and share traits for identifying and retaining leadership within your organization.</Abstract><Id>2941</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Cypress</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-08T15:00:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-08T14:15:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Sponsor Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName> </FirstName><GravatarUrl>http://cmprod-eventboard.azurewebsites.net/images/160px.OEConnection__raster.png</GravatarUrl><Id>713399E9-2F70-4FEC-A93C-D306B167CBF5</Id><LastName>OEConnection</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Other</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Leadership in Technology</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>[Presented by Jonathan Baker, Brandon Zeeb and Andy Conley]
As library collections shift from print materials to digital formats, and as the web enables ubiquitous and instantaneous discovery of information, library users expect to find and access materials online.   It’s not enough to have pages “on the web”; library data must be “woven into the web” and integrated into the sites and services that library users frequent daily – Google, Wikipedia, social networks.  When information about a library’s collection is locked up behind a specific web site (such as an OPAC), it is often exceedingly difficult for services, such as search engines, to that consume data. Information seekers need to be connected back to their local library resources from wherever they are on the web.

As a library cooperative, OCLC is at the forefront of linked data discussions and is leading the way in designing and implementing new approaches that re-envision, expose and share library data as entities that are part of the web.  The release of data for bibliographic entities - WorldCat Works - will over time be joined by other key entities.</Abstract><Id>2912</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Nile</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-08T15:00:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-08T14:15:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Sponsor Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName> </FirstName><GravatarUrl>http://cmprod-eventboard.azurewebsites.net/images/160px.OCLC__raster.png</GravatarUrl><Id>977D6BFB-BE83-4088-8CC1-91CBA4F7B160</Id><LastName>OCLC</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Other</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Linked Data and Semantic Web Development</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>[Presented by Michael Falanga]
Abstract:

Today's web applications have a lot of concerns.  In order to make applications more robust, JavaScript needs to be unit tested.  In order to reduce page weight and load times, CSS and JS files should be concatenated and minified.  To increase reliability across clients, they should not use cached versions of old CSS and JavaScript files.

In this talk, we will setup an ASP.Net MVC project that leverages the ASP.Net Web Optimization Framework and the grunt JavaScript task runner to create a front-end development environment that is both effective, productive, and easily integrated into your Continuous Integration server.

You have new tools like Jasmine, Selenium, Cucumber, Karma and Mocha. You integrate early and often with Jenkins, Travis and Bamboo. You do automated deployments, regression testing on pull requests and have code coverage metrics that would make your grandfather proud! You are an automation ninja but that accessibility thing is crimping your style. It doesn’t have to be that way. Come and learn how to integrate automated accessibility testing into all your modern tooling and restore the shine to your development workflow.

In this session Keith Rhodes, from Deque Systems,  will demonstrate automated accessibility testing for iOS and web applications with tooling from Deque. Then Jason Karns from Test Double will talk usage scenarios for the various alternatives when integrating accessibility tooling into your development workflow.

Wearable technologies are no longer a thing of the future. They offer real-world value and many organizations are looking to solve their critical business problems utilizing these technologies. We will be discussing the technology at the core of many of these devices Bluetooth Low Energy - how it works and how you can use it. We will also review two client based proof of concepts which have been implemented using wearable tech. The functionality and technology to be reviewed is:

1. Using Google Glasses to reduce human error and provide real-time system updates in a warehouse environment.
2. Using Bluetooth Low Energy devices to login to industrial equipment. This system gives an extra layer of physical security ensuring the right person is accessing the equipment.

When was the last time you hard-coded data? Databases have been around since the early days of computing. Architects spend time determining *which* database to use, not whether to build their own or not. Rule engines have existed for decades, yet they're relatively unknown. Developers waste millions of hours each year hard-coding logic that could be externalized, authored by business users or even developers themselves, and deployed to production in an instant. In this talk, Mike provides an overview of rule engines, where they provide great value...and where they don't.</Abstract><Id>2911</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Orange</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-08T15:00:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-08T14:15:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Sponsor Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName> </FirstName><GravatarUrl>http://cmprod-eventboard.azurewebsites.net/images/160px.InRuleTechnologyInc__raster.png</GravatarUrl><Id>EBC74119-9E19-4AB1-866D-999408597F0F</Id><LastName>InRule Technology, Inc.</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Other</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Why are you still hard-coding business logic?</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>[Presented by Jesse Liberty]

By the end of this session, you’ll rethink how your applications will store data in the future.</Abstract><Id>2528</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Orange</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-08T16:30:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-08T15:30:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>David</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/a007ab3dc89f80c08655bc626fb37fc7</GravatarUrl><Id>7c549c7b-06a8-4d9a-9c06-5103451cbdae</Id><LastName>Hoerster</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>.NET</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Cloud/Big Data</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Being RDBMS Free</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>In this world of ever increasing opportunities to purchase 'toys' classified as 'drones'... have you ever wanted to fly a drone?  Have you ever asked yourself the question... should I buy a drone or build?

This presentation will discuss why the term 'drone' should be most generally referred to as... 'multi-rotor copter' and not UAV (unmanned autonomous vehicle) or drone.  

This presentation will discuss the basics of how a multi-rotor works... the steps to build a multi-rotor... including details on flight controllers, frame selection, motors and props (including determining what type of multi-rotor will suite your purpose), speed controllers and batteries.  There are a lot of variables... all of these details will be broken down, making the process of building your first copter a 'flight in the park'.

At the end... a flying multi-rotor copter will be air-worthy and demonstrated.</Abstract><Id>2674</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Zambezi</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-08T16:30:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-08T15:30:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>DJ</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/5b94381f39bad8b12cf18e07ef43bea2</GravatarUrl><Id>fe140c90-c0ae-4990-aa8b-5144f80ae97f</Id><LastName>Daugherty</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Hardware</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>BYOD : build your own drone... multi-rotor copter that is !</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>We spend much of our time collecting and analyzing data.

You don't like working in JavaScript because you can't code like you want to with capital "O" Objects all over the place? Sure you can. More and more people are starting to realize how powerful this little language can be - start your re-education with this session and learn all about OOP in JS. First, we have to accept that while JavaScript may exhibit some characteristics of a functional language, it is really a multi-paradigm language with strong support for Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

This talk will give attendees a crash course in Object-Oriented JavaScript covering:
* core OOP principles
* the prototype object and constructors
* member access types (public, private, &amp; privileged)
* prototypical inheritance
* interfaces (mixins)

Developers will come out of this session ready to implement core OOP concepts in JavaScript, with knowledge of how inheritance in JavaScript differs from many of the other languages they know.</Abstract><Id>1220</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Cypress</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-08T16:30:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-08T15:30:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Jordan</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/f441bc8d508101ba0a1eac95d6cd52c6</GravatarUrl><Id>f76c74ea-5a60-4c0a-b5d0-f008ce85edec</Id><LastName>Kasper</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>JavaScript</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Object-Oriented JavaScript (yes, it really exists)</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>Mobile apps are a fixture in today's digital world.

Now that Roslyn is open source, you *could* just change the language to fit your needs – but that’s an option which is likely to make you unpopular with you colleagues. Instead, in many cases you can let the compiler act in a perfectly normal way – but add extra rules on top, either while you're coding, as part of your normal build, or as tests alongside your regular unit tests.

This session reflects my experience of using Roslyn (in the Visual Studio 2015 Preview) to try to enforce rules within the Noda Time code base. There are highlights, lowlights, and much more that can come in the future. At the end of this session, you should have some idea of what you can do with Roslyn code diagnostics: what's easy, what's hard, and what's not quite working yet.

It's highly likely that there are better approaches to some of the problems I'm tackling - so if we're lucky, we may be able to arrange a follow-on Open Space session with members of the Roslyn team to find out what my code should look like...</Abstract><Id>206</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Suite 1</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Suite 6</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-08T16:30:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-08T15:30:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Jon</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/9e8277f815de909df256027d206ca72a</GravatarUrl><Id>abec4332-6adf-41fe-9e60-0585e2e13bdb</Id><LastName>Skeet</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>.NET</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Testing</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Roslyn in the Real World</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>Ruby is known for Rails and the web.

The answer to this question may surprise you: they are both collections. This key insight holds the key to dramatically simplifying asynchronous programming in JavaScript. In this talk you will learn how you can use the familiar JavaScript Array methods to create surprisingly expressive asynchronous programs. Using just a few functions, you will learn how to do the following:
• Declaratively build complex events out of simple events (ex. drag n' drop)
• Coordinate and sequence multiple Ajax requests
• Reactively update UI's in response to data changes
• Eliminate memory leaks caused by neglecting to unsubscribe from events
• Gracefully propagate and handle asynchronous exception
 
In this talk we'll be exploring the Reactive Extensions (RxJS) library (http://github.com/reactive-extensions/RxJS), which allows us to treat events as collections. You'll learn about how Netflix uses Rx on the client and the server, allowing us to build end-to-end reactive systems. We'll also contrast Rx with Promises, another popular approach to building asynchronous programs in JavaScript.</Abstract><Id>2521</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Zambezi</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-08T17:45:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-08T16:45:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Matthew</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/174252c83d38873e74de232f58717fd7</GravatarUrl><Id>41d5aac4-a53f-4304-9303-feee91c934bf</Id><LastName>Podwysocki</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Mobile</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>JavaScript</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Functional Programming</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Async JavaScript at Netflix</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>The modern world of concurrency can certainly be confusing! This talk is a gentle introduction to the many forms of concurrency. In this talk, you'll learn which types of concurrency are appropriate for which scenarios.

Most developers have heard of parallelism, so this talk starts with parallel computing, showcasing the Parallel class and Parallel LINQ (PLINQ).

The next stop is asynchronous code. Asynchronous code is a totally different kind of concurrency than parallel processing, and the async and await keywords enable maintainable asynchronous code in modern applications.

This talk will also introduce you to TPL Dataflow. A beautiful mix of parallel and asynchronous techniques, TPL Dataflow is a little-known but extremely powerful library.

The last technology covered is Reactive Extensions. This talk will cover the concepts behind Rx and the most useful operators. This session is entirely practical; the phrase "mathematical dual of IEnumerable" does not appear on any slides.

As a company we face two major challenges:
  1.  Not breaking the Internet - if Bitly links stop working, a non-trivial part of the Internet just became much less useful.
  2.  Moving fast - we need to continually adapt to change and build new tools to provide more value to our users.

This presents the eternal challenge of accomplishing both stability and speed.   This talk will cover the processes, approaches, and tools used to do over 20-30 deploys each day to over 400 servers without causing any major disruptions to service.

Some of the topics to be covered include:
  * Benefits of Service Oriented Architecture
  * Designing with ops in mind from day one
  * The power of NSQ (realtime distributed messaging)
  * Asynchronous &gt; Synchronous (except when it isn't)
  * Designing for predictability
  * Route around failure (via hostpool)

What if your compiler could guarantee that your “Heartbleed-free” OpenSSL replacement follows the TLS specification to the letter, and even finds inconsistencies in the specification itself? What if you could write a test which showed that your code had no unintentional behavior, ever? Microsoft Research is well known for its contributions to Kinect, F#, the Entity Framework, and more, but it's also the home of a number of programming tools which do things which many programmers would consider surprising, if not impossible. But they work, and in this session you'll see them in action.

The Dafny language can check contracts at compile time. The Z3 theorem prover can solve problems from specifications alone, and is used to make Hyper-V and Windows Azure memory safe. The F7 specification language for F# was used by its authors used it to not only produce a TLS implementation which provably follows the spec, but also identified a dangerous hole in the TLS specification itself. You'll learn how Amazon uses the TLA+ specification language to prove that there are no edge cases in its internal protocols. Far from being research toys, these tools are in daily use in cases where stability, security, and reliability of code matters most. Can they help with your hardest problems?

It is actually fantastic for a very wide array of tasks, including web programming. Tachyus was able to go from 0 to production in 12 weeks using F#, replacing existing automated and manual systems for their first client. While this presentation focuses on F#, the talk is generally applicable to those interested in applying functional programming practices to their web applications.  In this talk, we evolve a web application written in the familiar MVC pattern to simpler, functional patterns available to functional languages like F# and exercise features such as function composition, computation expressions (async), type providers, and active patterns.</Abstract><Id>2766</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Salon H</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-08T17:45:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-08T16:45:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Ryan</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/383ac8889ab4215414c57e2b767ec7fa</GravatarUrl><Id>5a82a165-0f5e-45e1-b355-cb172ca4c712</Id><LastName>Riley</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>.NET</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Functional Programming</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Zero to Production in Twelve Weeks with F# on the Web</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>Thursday Dinner</Abstract><Id>3002</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Killamanjaro Ballroom</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-08T19:30:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-08T18:00:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>CodeMash Schedule Item</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName> </FirstName><GravatarUrl>http://www.codemash.org/wp-content/themes/codemash/images/codemash-icon.png</GravatarUrl><Id>275c4701-2744-4f7a-b1e7-58e0e284f1e9</Id><LastName>CodeMash</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Other</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Dinner</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>The MakerGear team will drop-in from Cleveland for 3D Printing After Dark.

However they don't always do exactly what we we'd like them to. The class we need is marked internal or the DLL itself was released with bugs. Luckily we can fix all that. Join Josh as he shows you how to manipulate DLLs both manually and programatically with Mono.Cecil. We'll walk through the hotfix of a bug in the Roslyn compiler by rewriting one of the DLLs released by Microsoft.

Have you ever asked yourself the question… should I buy a drone or build? This presentation will discuss why the term ‘drone’ should be most generally referred to as… ‘multi-rotor copter’ and not UAV (unmanned autonomous vehicle) or drone. This presentation will discuss the basics of how a multi-rotor works… the steps to build a multi-rotor… including details on flight controllers, frame selection, motors and props (including determining what type of multi-rotor will suite your purpose), speed controllers and batteries. There are a lot of variables… all of these details will be broken down, making the process of building your first copter a ‘flight in the park’. At the end… a flying multi-rotor copter will be air-worthy and demonstrated.</Abstract><Id>3009</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Zambezi</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-08T22:00:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-08T19:30:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>After Dark</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>DJ</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/5b94381f39bad8b12cf18e07ef43bea2</GravatarUrl><Id>fe140c90-c0ae-4990-aa8b-5144f80ae97f</Id><LastName>Daugherty</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Hardware</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Other</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Build Your Own Drone - From the Ground Up</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>Using a custom deck of Extreme Programming playing cards, we will play a game that will challenge your knowledge of XP problems, solutions, and values.

Literally repeated code can be easily remedied, but there are other more subtle and insidious kinds of code duplication.  What about code that's the same except for type, or code that needs to be applied in many locations?  In this session, you will learn about tools to help find duplicate code.  After identifying problem code, you will learn how to eradicate it with software design techniques and .NET framework features.  Specifically, you will see how to apply generics, delegates, extension methods, and attributes to quash repeated code. You will leave with ideas and techniques to reduce duplicated code in your development.

And they don't like the "{hot new framework} is taking care of that for us" answer. So what do you do?

Easy: OWASP has you covered. The Top Ten are the most common vulnerabilities you'll encounter, but they're pretty easy to avoid if you know how. There's even example code for each one -- it's in Ruby on Rails, but that's not the point.

It’s the spaces in between--the details that tie all the elements together, make the big moments gigantic, and the special moments memorable.

It’s the same with design. Whether you’re wireframing an app or building a corporate website, the design is the story you tell. 

You’ve already learned everything you need to know to about user centered design from comics.

Learning by doing, we'l pair with a buddy, hear a little theory, and then get to testing. We'll have some more theory, then test a second application, then a third - then conduct a retrospective to talk about how these techniques can combine to improve coverage of the application, reducing time-to-done, and allow teams to compress testing into iterations, sprints, and other timeboxes.</Abstract><Id>2629</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Mangrove</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-09T09:30:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-09T08:30:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Matthew</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/029780fa46bfc1d919adc994c3d0abb3</GravatarUrl><Id>ccd1bddf-2c93-4559-82f7-07092b297986</Id><LastName>Heusser</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Testing</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Exploratory Testing for Everybody!</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>It's your information, why don't you use it? Too many times, businesses and developers collect different forms of text-based data that then go unused, collecting dust in some data warehouse. This session will introduce developers to several ways businesses are leveraging text analytics and natural language processing to improve business practices or inform decision-making processes. Types of data used in the examples may include company websites, invoices, record narratives and social media. The majority of examples and tools demonstrated will be python based.

It's asynchronous. It's Hacker News worthy, and it runs your Javascript on V8. Of course V8 is a great Javascript runtime brought to you by some very talented developers. But what about us poor souls who live our lives on the Java Virtual Machine? With 3 choices available today - Rhino, Nashorn and DynJS, it is possible to run Javascript on the JVM. But what about Node? Node.js is mostly Javascript, so surely it can't be too hard to run it on the JVM. In this talk you'll learn what it take to run your Node.js applications along side your Java bits.

The presentation will explore the Node.js process bindings which couple it with  V8. You will see how the Nodyn project (http://nodyn.io) uses these bindings, along with the DynJS Javascript runtime (http://dynjs.org) and Netty (http://netty.io) for asynchronous IO, to provide a viable Node.js environment on the JVM. There will be some code examples, and you'll get a glimpse into the nitty gritty details that make Nodyn and Node.js on the JVM possible. </Abstract><Id>2851</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Rosewood</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-09T09:30:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-09T08:30:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Lance</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/b0690265bd924922c38abcc377748957</GravatarUrl><Id>0384c3c8-0c6e-4abd-90d5-7638c9df4fd5</Id><LastName>Ball</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>JavaScript</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Java</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Process Bindings: How to do Node.js on the JVM</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>
Regardless of how you feel about felines, dead cats stink. 

What also stinks is what is happening to agile development practices.  What started as a movement to increase quality and usefulness of code written, has been professionalized into certificates and ceremonies that are only marginally helping the process.  Instead of blaming political and organizational forces, this humorous and irreverent talk focuses on what team members can do to overcome these corporate obstacles and to get to the spirit of agile through a focus on architectural innovation and personal improvement.  Attendees should expect to laugh, to learn from the experience of implementing dozens of real world enterprise agile teams, and to come out with proven new techniques to try to bring more satisfaction to how they do their work and to bring the focus of agile back to software development.  </Abstract><Id>1357</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Sagewood</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Zebrawood</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-09T09:30:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-09T08:30:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Paul</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/4959d2239464d669c0125462a9622dc4</GravatarUrl><Id>b7ad6108-017a-4b46-9ec4-0c25b244f622</Id><LastName>Holway</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Soft Skills / Business</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Reclaiming agile development: don't let the cat die...</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>This session will “walk" through the CoreMotion framework.

The draw of independence, self-reliance, growth and profit potential are all very appealing to the right kind of individual.  Indeed being a freelance consultant or part of a small company can prove to be extraordinarily rewarding.

However, as folks say, "with great power comes great responsibility."  Running a software business is about a lot more than writing code.  This session will consider the easily overlooked, but ever-important, legal and tax implications of your actions and decisions as a business owner.

The discussion will delve into the major issues facing new small businesses.  Topics include finding the right advisors; choosing an appropriate business entity (e.g., partnership, corporation, LLC); asset protection for your business and your family; taxes; and how to actually pay yourself.

Armed with a bit of knowledge and the right questions, you will be able to approach your legal and tax advisors confidently, empowered to make the best possible decisions for your situation.</Abstract><Id>2530</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Salon E</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-09T09:30:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-09T08:30:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Jeff</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/c546a0d187d12bb1c81f0918c956c55a</GravatarUrl><Id>75538a62-da47-413c-8c73-1fb87c6c3fa4</Id><LastName>Strauss</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Soft Skills / Business</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>The Business Side of Starting Your Business</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>The 2.0.1.5 scavenger hunt is on!

By comparison, migrating databases seems like a paltry feat.

Birdwave is a way to visualize the amazing phenomenon of bird migration. Using ClojureScript and Om allowed the app to be written in a  declarative, concise manner, taking full advantage of JavaScript interoperability, as well as Clojure's awesome built-in features such as persistent data structures and the async module. Also, prepare to be dazzled by the data-viz powerhouse that is D3.

No birds were harmed in the creation of Birdwave. Or this talk.

Code for this talk will be in C# with PostSharp however the concepts can be applied to virtually any programming language or AOP tool.</Abstract><Id>2590</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Salon A</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-09T10:45:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-09T09:45:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Nerdy</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/98bf55144f7e2f3ab18cf6a3e5fdb019</GravatarUrl><Id>13ad1778-7239-4aac-b1fa-3dfdf174068d</Id><LastName>Beardo</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>.NET</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Security</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Defense in Depth with AOP</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>While Machine Learning practitioners routinely use a wide range of tools and languages, C# is conspicuously absent from that arsenal. Is .NET inadequate for Machine Learning? In this talk, I'll argue that it can be a great fit, as long as you use the right language for the job, namely F#.
F# is a functional-first language, with a concise and expressive syntax that will feel familiar to data scientists used to Python or Matlab. It combines the performance and maintainability benefits of statically typed languages, with the flexibility of Type Providers, a unique mechanism that enables seamless consumption of virtually any data source. And as a first-class .NET citizen, it interops smoothly with C#. So if you are interested in a language that can handle both flexible data exploration and the pressure of a real production system, come check out what F# has to offer.</Abstract><Id>2675</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Salon D</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-09T10:45:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-09T09:45:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Mathias</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/656d522b5a93ff6b337d66c0a247e7cb</GravatarUrl><Id>9725474f-2638-4ee9-8ea8-b3847933769c</Id><LastName>Brandewinder</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>.NET</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Functional Programming</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>F# and Machine Learning: a Winning Combination</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>Performance in the cloud comes from the ability to scale out.  Unfortunately, your options to scale up instead of out in the cloud can often be limited and in some cases even the biggest cloud instance you can provision is far less powerful than the on premise server you are migrating from.  

This presentation will share techniques and lessons learned from real world experience when deploying large existing ASP.Net/SQL Server applications to Windows Azure.   While some abstract concepts will be discussed, the primary focus of this presentation will be to give attendees practical technical solutions that can be applied to dramatically improve performance in the cloud without major code/architecture changes and in many cases the techniques covered in this presentation are also highly effective in non-cloud environments.</Abstract><Id>2635</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Rosewood</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-09T10:45:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-09T09:45:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Chris</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/af5f13b80c75430f7e2f4ef1efc2f4e8</GravatarUrl><Id>77303af7-6d12-4bea-ac48-51f769853b6c</Id><LastName>Farrell</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>.NET</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Cloud/Big Data</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>From Scale up to Scale Out - Migrating our App from Big Iron to the Cloud </Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>I don’t know about you, but vanilla CSS always leaves me wanting more. It’s a fairly simple language, can do some pretty powerful things, but after a while... well, it can become rather tedious to work with. 

Enter Sass: Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets. Sass is a CSS meta-language and precompiler that makes the prettification of your website a breeze by adding invaluable features of more traditional programming languages. 

In this workshop, we’ll jump right in to the Sass workflow and cover all the key game changers - nesting, variables, mixins, inheritance, and directives. We’ll also cover some of the gotchyas, tools and extensions, and tips on organization and coding standards.</Abstract><Id>70</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Nile</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-09T10:45:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-09T09:45:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Julie</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/f49c5780805d9e50bdc348069a7db59d</GravatarUrl><Id>1702ac5d-8845-435f-b2dc-6bbb70c7778a</Id><LastName>Cameron</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Design (UI/UX/CSS)</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Getting Sassy With CSS</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>
"Oh no! I just typed something into git and now my work is gone! Ahh!"

Don't panic. Contrary to popular belief, git is one of the most non-destructive version control systems available. When used right, git
never loses any data, and even when misused, chances are very high you can still recover.

This talk will present turn-by-turn directions on how to recover from a wide array of common git mistakes, and also provide some workflows
to minimize them.

On nights and weekends, he built a little tool to help the team test the site. And then things got interesting.

In this talk, Fiddler-builder Eric Lawrence explains how Fiddler grew from a rough side-project to a powerful and popular tool used by millions worldwide. After a brief overview of its technical evolution, the session covers never-before-revealed details about how Fiddler "escaped" from Microsoft and the long and stressful acquisition process. He shares lessons learned, what he'd do differently today, and inspiration for others hoping to convert their passion into their full-time job.

Or how the download of large file completes even after you switched out of the app to a different one while the download is still in progress? Find out how these and other such capabilities are enabled in this talk on multitasking support on the iOS platform. 
Multitasking is the ability to run multiple apps on the device at the same time.  Previously available in restricted form to a certain category of apps, now with iOS7, Apple introduced some powerful advancements to this feature. The platform now uses an intelligent algorithm that guarantees optimal battery usage while ensuring that all apps get a fair chance to run in the background. Making this even more powerful is the ability for data transfers to occur even when the app is not running! 
This talk will discuss and demonstrate the multitasking capabilities  on the iOS platform and the APIs that you can leverage to support these capabilities within your own apps.
 This talk is recommended for anyone developing or interested in developing apps for the iPhone/iPad.

However, even after 15 years of use in the industry, there still isn't an easy way to create a consistent development environment for all team members and unit test server-deployed components. JEE developers still experience the pain of big bang integration testing unless they're willing to put forth the time intensive work required to create unit-testable server-deployed components. Using Docker and Maven in conjunction with SoapUI makes it easy to unit test server-deployed components. This session demonstrates how using Docker in your continuous integration environment brings new levels of agility to JEE development.
Along with a discussion of the benefits of creating layered Docker images, you will also learn how to:

Create a layered JEE Application Server image

Layer a domain on top of the JEE Application Server image

Autodeploy a JEE application to the domain

Use Maven in conjunction with SoapUI to unit test your component

The Don’t Repeat Yourself principle tells us to stop the cycle of evil, but merely building abstractions only gets us a little DRY.

How can we get completely DRY? This is where conventions come in. Conventions can make your app smarter, getting rid of the obvious stuff without having to resort to more rudimentary tools like code generation.

You'll see common tools that embrace conventions, where they work well and what pitfalls to avoid. You’ll also look at building your own conventions in the web, mobile and more. Finally you'll look at diagnostics and testing to remove the magic that scares too many developers away.</Abstract><Id>2702</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Indigo Bay</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-09T12:00:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-09T11:00:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Jimmy</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/cc359c5ccf90d7a24b5976316797b5ec</GravatarUrl><Id>fb46aa8e-e81e-498d-a7d5-638a1c643679</Id><LastName>Bogard</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>JavaScript</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>.NET</d3p1:string></Tags><Title> Keeping yourself DRY with conventions</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>Have you ever needed to access a data source in your application?

Why not just set some bounded constraints and generate a more exhaustive set of circumstances that your program or system is contracted and believed to satisfy? In this talk, through examples in Clojure’s test.check and Erlang’s QuickCheck, I’ll demonstrate how to easily compose and apply generators for various use-cases, including generating data from schema/validation libraries like Clojure's Prismatic Schema and Herbert and using a finite state machine to model stateful code with side-effects via Erlang QuickCheck’s eqc_statem. We can apply these generations toward all kinds of problem spaces: from testable database environments to property-based tests for capturing what’s true/valid and what better be false.</Abstract><Id>2507</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Rosewood</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-09T12:00:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-09T11:00:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Zeeshan</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/5cf448e5edc7dc73659e3f42baff490a</GravatarUrl><Id>eb15a235-5ab2-4267-a6b6-356f96a9d6ce</Id><LastName>Lakhani</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Testing</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Functional Programming</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Generating Circumstances</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>ElasticSearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK) combine to make arbitrary and disparate logs accessible in one convenient and indexed location.  When logs from different servers and applications are combined, the real power of logging becomes apparent.  Using these 3 open-source technologies can super-charge real-time tracing, as well as enable mid and long-term trending analysis.  ELK can even make logs interesting to Business and Product Analysts.  

This session will highlight the simplicity and flexibility of ELK.  The session will also show how OCLC used minor changes to the application logging to enhance event correlation, as well as the benefits the organization realized by moving logs through ELK.

However, the design process has not kept up. Too often static comps are used as the only touchpoint between designers and decision makers, presenting the designs in an out of context and limiting format. What needs to be done is to adapt each step of the design process to convey scaling, device context, motion and interactivity to give a more realistic idea of how the designs work.

The Android Test framework is slow, and requires either an emulator or a physical device to test upon.  There are other solutions like Robotium or UIAutomator but these lend themselves to writing tests that drive the UI and lean toward Integration tests.  While these are necessary part of testing, they don't provide quick feed back to the developer.

This talk will discuss lessons learned from using Robolectric 2.3 and Mockito to bring some sanity to unit testing Android applications.  Allowing for a true test driven development with fast test execution and fast developer feedback of failures.   We will review some dos and don'ts when using Robolectric, and when Mockito may be a better fit.   Examples will be shown  from using these frameworks to provide unit test coverage for an Android TV application, but the same techniques can be used for any Android application.</Abstract><Id>1312</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Mangrove</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-09T12:00:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-09T11:00:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>David</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/fdec28d17fb2417999492a96fb338eae</GravatarUrl><Id>919bfa57-d844-4cff-bf89-e88957489b60</Id><LastName>Carver</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Mobile</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Testing</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Stop Going Bald trying to Unit Test Android Applications.</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>Web frameworks help you build an API quickly but most have little support for dealing with an API that needs to evolve, forcing you to prematurely version your API.

Take back control of the content you send over the wire.  API responses are the "user interface" of your API and should be crafted with same attention to detail that cause designers to fret over color choices, shadows and highlights.


In this talk I’ll show you what I have learned about API response design in the last 8 years of building Web APIs.

Frontend devs are forced to think about 3rd party package managers, CSS precompilers, Javascript code linters, design frameworks like Bootstrap, Javascript module systems, and of course Javascript frameworks and toolsets like Ember, Angular, or Backbone.

Is the Javascript community crazy? Yes. Are all these disparate tools a bad thing? No. Not if you have a good build system.

In this talk, learn how to use gulp.js to combine the best of these Javascript and frontend tools and improve your development quality and speed. You will walk away with useable code for your build system as well as practical examples of how to create organized, modular Javascript code.

Also known as active patterns, this feature allows one to extend the pattern-matching capabilities of the language. Active recognizers may be put to great effect in taming unruly APIs, improving the declarative style of one's code, constructing embedded DSLs, and much more. This talk will be given in a lecture format, interspersing digestible code samples with detailed breakdown of syntax. Additional consideration will be given, time permitting, to appropriate use-cases for active recognizers and a discussion of the under-lying mechanics. The review is aimed at advanced beginners who are familiar with F#'s general syntax and usage. Also, while not strictly necessary, those wishing to follow along via computer are encouraged to have, at least, version 2.0 of the core F# tools.

It’s a critical game because we fix bugs from the time we first check in code, and the cost of each bug tends to increase across the project lifecycle. Come to this talk to merge strategy with the debugging tools in your environment. In the examples, you’ll see debugging features in the current version of Visual Studio and upcoming in Visual Studio “14,” along with Windows features like ETW (Event Tracing for Windows). Good debugging strategies let you ask better questions and tools offer an array of tactics to efficiently answer most questions.  Strategies and tactics differ a bit depending on the difficulty of the bug and where you can reproduce it. If it occurs only in production and remote debugging is not possible in your scenario, you’ll debug through piles of information. Find out what Windows can provide for you, without changing your application, and small changes to your application that increase the value of this information. Leave this talk ready to formulate ideas into testable strategies you can execute to resolve bugs faster and with more confidence. </Abstract><Id>2594</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Cypress</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-09T13:15:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-09T12:15:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Kathleen</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/85ffa8bf46389d3c399196f3497bd626</GravatarUrl><Id>0858d0e5-564d-494d-aed6-8d5f744ebe37</Id><LastName>Dollard</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>.NET</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Better Code, Better Debugging</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>When Java came on to the scene, it changed everything….

The project kicked off using Backbone and things were great. Until they were not great. Pages starting getting more and more involved and blame started being thrown at the technology choice.

A move to Ember.js ensued and the app was rewritten. But architecturally bad decisions don't hide long, and soon the rewrite was preforming even worse.

I’ve had a front row seat to how our ideas about framework and tooling usability have changed from out of control Xml configuration to way too many attributes to fluent interface “experimentation” to using conventional approaches and simpler API's.  Unfortunately, I’ve created usability problems and hidden framework behavior that I’ve had to fix over the years and I’ve had to learn how to cater to user’s problems rather than the internal details of the framework.  I’ve had to continuously work over the diagnostic capabilities of StructureMap to try to unravel nasty “why won’t this work!” episodes.  In short, come to this talk and I might be able to help you dodge some of the problems I’ve faced over the past decade.</Abstract><Id>2442</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Indigo Bay</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-09T13:15:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-09T12:15:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Jeremy</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/83a17261fd4c9f537e63165df6ba57bb</GravatarUrl><Id>5c43507c-a53e-452c-b0d0-0432fdfc35cd</Id><LastName>Miller</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>.NET</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Lessons Learned from a Long Lived Codebase</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>Now that mobile apps are invading the enterprise, and security breaches are a reality, an authenticated login is vital. When building web sites, login security gets taken for granted, because the browser utilizes lots of security mechanisms with built-in functionality created by armies of developers over many years. Mobile apps don't quite get this for free. Mobile authentication should leverage mechanisms and technologies already in place in web apps instead of inventing something new, despite every developer's innate inclination to do just that. Native mobile developers have to code something specific to make web-based authentication work, that's the point of this presentation. Learn about authenticating mobile apps against web servers using OAUTH, HTTPS, NTLM, derived credentials, and anything else with a snazzy acronym. Demonstrations will use your platform as long as it's iOS or Android.</Abstract><Id>202</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Salon A</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-09T13:15:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-09T12:15:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>David</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/555338823dc02d51083a3fdba2852960</GravatarUrl><Id>5bd32894-f84d-45fc-9d79-a9cff2afa852</Id><LastName>Truxall</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Mobile</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Security</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Mobile Authentication in the Web World</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>Why do we all know a developer who has been pounding out unmaintainable code for a decade or more? Why do people "believe in TDD but I don't have time to write tests during crunch?" How is it that we have an entire industry based around rescuing teams from acutely awful Rails apps? 

It's because on the job experience is a poor teacher; plateauing as soon as the developer is able to ship code that meets requirements. Schools teach Computer Science which is only tangentially related to being a developer and most kata's are approached incorrectly, giving no value at best, and reinforcing poor practices at worst. On top of all this, our pairs (for the lucky ones who pair program) probably have not shown us anything new in months.

This presentation will give specific, concrete steps on how to slowly and steadily improve our game through practice and hard work. I'll identify what skill Rails developers should be focusing on and walk the audience through how to target and eliminate these weaknesses so that nothing but white hot joy streams out of our fingers and into our apps. There's no magic here, no secrets, and no hacks; just you and me working our butts off until we suck a little less.</Abstract><Id>1338</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Rosewood</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-09T13:15:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-09T12:15:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Zach</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/dfe1da2a83fe42aa8a07df1f0071becb</GravatarUrl><Id>55051bcd-69d3-487e-822d-9025cf3b0c86</Id><LastName>Briggs</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Ruby/Rails</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Nobody Will Train You but You</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>An important part of any mobile application is being able to send it notifications and trigger updates that present timely information to users.

Distributed denial of service attacks are on the rise and their size and scope increases with each attack. From the recent attacks on Sony by the Lizard Squad, to attacks against a variety of DNS providers, including DNSimple, 2014 was a tough year for infrastructure service providers and consumer-facing services alike. In this talk I will describe various types of DDoS attacks, how and why attackers use them and how you can defend against them. I will talk in detail about the attacks we saw in 2014 at DNSimple, how we detected them and how we are dealing with them. Finally, I'll talk about the future of DDoS defense and the challenges we face in 2015 and beyond.</Abstract><Id>2938</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Mangrove</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-09T14:15:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-09T13:30:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Sponsor Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName> </FirstName><GravatarUrl>http://cmprod-eventboard.azurewebsites.net/images/160px.DNSimple__raster.png</GravatarUrl><Id>cff37d73-3bc4-4a4d-bab3-a6235ddf9e07</Id><LastName>DNSimple</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Security</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Other</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Anatomy of a DDoS and Defense Techniques</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>[Presented by Craig Courtney, Stephen Langella, Scott Oster]

In this presentation Jay will cover 10 ways any developer can become a highly productive developer.</Abstract><Id>2928</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Salon E</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-09T14:15:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-09T13:30:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Sponsor Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName> </FirstName><GravatarUrl>http://cmprod-eventboard.azurewebsites.net/images/160px.Billhighway__raster.png</GravatarUrl><Id>E7A23E4F-2426-487C-88F2-B76637B13671</Id><LastName>Billhighway</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Other</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>How Productive Are You?

On your way to work one morning, you walk by your favorite coffee shop. As you walk by, you notice a sign in the window with the day's specials:
$1 off Lattes today!
That's nice, but maybe Latte isn't your favorite…
 
Now imagine this...
 
Same scenario, but as you approach the coffee shop (let's say 100 feet away), your phone suddenly notifies you with the following message:

"Good Morning, Chris.  Your favorite Cookie Crumble Mocha is only a few steps away.  Stop in and we'll take $1 off your total!"

This is a much more direct, targeted, and context-aware approach!
 
By using Beacons you can make a huge impact to Customer Service, Revenue Generation, and Operational Efficiency.  In this seminar you will learn what Beacons are, their implications in various industries and implementation strategies.</Abstract><Id>2943</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Portia</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Wisteria</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-09T14:15:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-09T13:30:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Sponsor Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName i:nil="true" /><GravatarUrl>http://cmprod-eventboard.azurewebsites.net/images/160px.CentricConsulting__raster.png</GravatarUrl><Id>b0514ad2-a2bb-4cde-9068-02481a0e0e92</Id><LastName>Centric Consulting</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Other</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Micro-location with Beacons: Navigating the way with Mobility, Big Data, and the Cloud</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>[Presented by Tony Milne]

Process is one of the most misunderstood aspects of software development. Period. 

Twenty years of experience in software development has shown us that lack of process is one of the most prevalent reasons why projects fail. Lack of process permits introduction of random change, fosters scope creep and allows for an inordinate amount of focus on one aspect of a system rather than the overall success of the project. Our experience has also shown us, however, that proper application of the RIGHT process for a specific scenario can be crucial in delivering successful projects on time and within budget.

This session focuses on the role of process in the software development cycle.  It discusses a number of the well-established processes available in our field (Agile, Staged Delivery, Evolutionary Prototyping, Waterfall, Code &amp; Fix, etc.) and points out the pros and cons of each. Rather than pitching the fabulousness of a single particular “silver bullet” approach, this session demonstrates how drinking the kool-aid of a specific process and then trying to ram every situation into it is faulty.  The session is designed to help Software Development Managers and Team Leads recognize that there is no one “best” process – not by project type, nor by team size, nor even within a single company. It will not only help participants understand the pros and cons of the major established processes, but will also help them identify which processes are best suited for a variety of common development scenarios.  By the end of the session, participants will understand why the most important aspects of process are (1) picking the right one for the situation, and (2) adhering to it once you do.

This session is one in a series of Stout Systems’ new educational seminars that are geared towards what we call “The Accidental or Reluctant Software Development Manager” … someone who has been thrust into the role of managing a software development team, often against their wishes and with no formal training in the unique challenges of that role.

So if you are in an agile team then this talk is for you. To produce good quality software repeatedly and at an ever increasing frequency, means we all (not just testers) need to adapt. Believe it or not you can’t just test faster, but you can make smarter choices. More often than not, you must automate but automation does not solve everything. More fundamental to improving the testing is the techniques you apply in determining what to test. How to test them comes second. This session will cover ways to adapt your approach and offer practical examples of techniques to use to identify the areas to test. It will also cover testing approaches that can then be applied to test the areas identified.</Abstract><Id>1370</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Indigo Bay</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-09T15:45:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-09T14:45:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Emma</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/113cf25968d18a6ce4f66be22e6a73f8</GravatarUrl><Id>0d77e7b9-8315-4197-a135-6091933cbda0</Id><LastName>Armstrong</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Testing</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Adapt your testing approach for agile</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>As software developers we should always be striving to give our users the best experience possible. It should be intuitive, responsive and above all fast! With traditional web technologies, creating applications that appear “fast” to the users can be difficult. To solve this problem developers have been finding new and creative ways to leverage the browsers client-side functionality. One of the most popular frameworks for creating a web application with powerful client-side front end functionality is Angular. Angular is a powerful client side data framework that lets you bind and manipulate data easily in a way that seems lightning fast to your users. And the best part is you don’t need to be a JavaScript ninja to use it! This session will show you how to leverage Angular with your ASP.NET MVC application to create applications that your users will love and you’ll love to build.</Abstract><Id>2565</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Zambezi</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-09T15:45:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-09T14:45:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>James</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/25ddbfa83fef9e5f8f1e15c73d1de9e1</GravatarUrl><Id>3ced0b93-06e0-42e0-be28-f1267bcaf0a4</Id><LastName>Bender</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>JavaScript</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>.NET</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Angular for .NET Developers</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>Like most things in life, there’s the easy way and the hard way.

Each year, the game is a complete grounds-up build and gives the team the chance to hack together various cool technologies such as Wii remotes, pneumatics, servos, and computer vision.  In this session, the Sneeds will cover the game design principles they follow and will show off some of the tech they've hacked together, including using OpenCV to build a game that uses $2 rubber balls as input devices to a zombie game in .Net.

But have you ever wondered what Rx will look like as a language?

Elm is a new programming language based on the idea of Functional Reactive Programming (FRP). Elm lets you create highly interactive web applications without all the messy callbacks tangling around shared states.

In this talk Yan Cui will give a gentle introduction to Elm and share his experience learning the language and how he used Elm to recreate Missile Command in less than 250 LOC. You will leave this session with a handle on the Functional Reactive paradigm and a basic understanding of Elm.</Abstract><Id>80</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Guava</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Tamarind</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-09T15:45:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-09T14:45:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Yan</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/0bbaed5a18c131ba152cf566e1becaf8</GravatarUrl><Id>1ed75aea-1301-40c3-8d0d-af03a2763414</Id><LastName>Cui</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Functional Programming</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>My adventure with Elm</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>Scrum may have one the brand-war as the most popular of Agile Methods - but is it working?

Jim was a constant at Codemash and one of its most popular speakers. In this presentation, we'll reflect on the man and some of his best work:

- highly influential projects such as Rake, Rspec/Given, and Builder
- software design guidelines that lead to cleaner and more maintainable code
- applying lessons and patterns from one language to another
- mentoring others to help them learn
- the importance of hacking and curiosity

and more. Jim's work has made an impact on many and remains as relevant as ever. Come join us we look back on Jim's amazing legacy and how that output continues to prove valuable for us today.</Abstract><Id>118</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Aloeswood</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Leopardwood</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-09T15:45:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-09T14:45:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Mike</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/38716536d6ac1c63fc17ae4fa1cfca0c</GravatarUrl><Id>6e19a7c8-db38-480b-8258-9f9e72ae19b1</Id><LastName>Doel</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Ruby/Rails</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Other</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>The Jim Weirich Legacy</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>KidzMash Kaboomz</Abstract><Id>2956</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Suite 1</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Suite 6</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-09T17:00:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-09T15:30:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Kidz Mash</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName> </FirstName><GravatarUrl>http://www.codemash.org/wp-content/themes/codemash/images/codemash-icon.png</GravatarUrl><Id>275c4701-2744-4f7a-b1e7-58e0e284f1e9</Id><LastName>CodeMash</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Other</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>KidzMash Closing</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>This talk will introduce developers to the MongoDB NoSQL platform and explain how it can be utilized as a robust data store alternative for your applications.

The SPA universe is full of choices (Backbone, Angular, Ember and more).  What sets them apart, and how do you choose one?  They all address the same problem set: rendering, routing, data-binding, event handling, composability and others.  By dissecting how different frameworks approach these problems, we can investigate the quirks that set frameworks apart and gain a more intimate understanding of the SPA architecture itself.

Or why people are sure they have observed something they have not?  These issues affect all people, including developers and testers.  In his book Thinking Fast and Slow, Nobel winner Daniel Kahneman introduces two mental systems, one that is fast and the other slow. Together they shape our impressions of the world around us and help us make choices. System 1 is largely unconscious and makes snap judgments based upon memory of similar events and emotions. System 2 is painfully slow, and is the process by which facts are thought about consciously, carefully, and rationally. However, System 2 is easily distracted and System 1 is wrong quite often and is easily swayed by our emotions. These cognitive biases affect how people investigate, observe, and recall events.  This session will, through a few interactive games, learn how cognitive biases affect one’s abilities to investigate, observe, and recall events (all skills good testers need).  During those games, strategies are discussed to reduce the impacts of those cognitive biases.</Abstract><Id>100</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Aloeswood</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Leopardwood</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-09T17:00:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-09T16:00:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>Regular Session</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName>Joseph</FirstName><GravatarUrl>//www.gravatar.com/avatar/e8db3a295983267553712deca404aa72</GravatarUrl><Id>bf9b2e1f-b65b-4dc8-8ad2-edba88004656</Id><LastName>Ours</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Testing</d3p1:string><d3p1:string>Soft Skills / Business</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Thinking Fast and Slow</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>Ruby is very friendly and a great choice for developers kicking off their careers.  It is also a mirror.  It reflects what you know about yourself.  By exploring our own mental strengths and limitations, we can learn how to hone our skills to write amazingly better code.

While all examples are focused on Ruby, the techniques are all about you, the developer.  The session will explain the psychological underpinnings of Don’t-Repeat-Yourself.  With the groundwork framed we explore Tell-Don’t-Ask, Functional Core, and module/class/method naming with insights to help make good decisions balancing human mental faculties versus the capabilities of the computer.

The family is invited.</Abstract><Id>2989</Id><Room i:nil="true" /><Rooms xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Killamanjaro Ballroom</d3p1:string></Rooms><SessionEndTime>2015-01-09T18:00:00</SessionEndTime><SessionStartTime>2015-01-09T17:00:00</SessionStartTime><SessionTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00</SessionTime><SessionType>CodeMash Schedule Item</SessionType><Speakers><PublicSpeakerThinDataModel><FirstName> </FirstName><GravatarUrl>http://www.codemash.org/wp-content/themes/codemash/images/codemash-icon.png</GravatarUrl><Id>275c4701-2744-4f7a-b1e7-58e0e284f1e9</Id><LastName>CodeMash</LastName></PublicSpeakerThinDataModel></Speakers><Tags xmlns:d3p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><d3p1:string>Other</d3p1:string></Tags><Title>Closing Raffle</Title></PublicSessionDataModel><PublicSessionDataModel><Abstract>There will be some light appetizers, and some drinks, to give you time to reflect on your CodeMash experience, and say goodbye to your new friends.
